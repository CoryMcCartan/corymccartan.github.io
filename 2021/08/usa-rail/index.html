<p><span class="leadin">Suppose&mdash;hypothetically&mdash;that</span> you find yourself
one evening, early in the second summer of our pandemic, reading your email,
when you open up an advertisement for discounted train tickets. Suppose
that you have recently looked into cross-country airline tickets and found
yourself dismayed at the prices, compared to what you’d grown accustomed to
over the past year.  And suppose that your work over that same period has
largely consisted of talking to small boxes on your computer screen, and that
it is finally summertime, and that many countries are not allowing you to
travel to visit them, and that you know that New Mexico is a real place that is
supposed to be nice and which lies somewhere between you, sitting at your
computer in the Northeast, and the other side of the country.  Only then might
you—a person who would never be swayed by something as trivial as an
advertisement—begin to consider the possibility of your getting on a train,
sitting on it for two weeks, and in doing so crossing almost the entirety of
the country.</p>
<p>There are several considerations that might make the proposition more
attractive.  First, the price—ten trips on nearly any Amtrak train, at any time
in a thirty-day window, all for the cost of a one-way plane ticket from Boston
to Seattle.  Seeing as you can cross the country in as little as two trips,
this leaves significant flexibility to spend a day or two at points along your
route, or to travel on more scenic segments.  You may pull up the Amtrak System
Map, tracing possible paths across the country, through towns you’ve never
heard of—Winnemucca, Needles, Kannapolis.  You may be swept up in the majesty
of Amtrak’s promotional photographs, imagining yourself on one of the silver
trains curving through ochre canyons at sunrise, enjoying your breakfast in the
dining car.</p>
<figure class="w100"><img src="pictures/amtrak-zephyr-promotion.webp"

        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Just as you convince yourself that the whole thing is a good idea, and you
start to pore over timetables in order to string together ten trip segments
into a continental journey, several doubts will begin to nag you.  (Delays! The
sheer distance! The time! Your work! Food! Delays! Coronavirus! Showering?)
But you will push these aside as you put in your credit card information and
purchase the ten-trip pass.</p>
<center style="margin: 2em;"><img src="section_break.png" width=144 /></center>
<p><span class="leadin">Now that you are committed,</span> several things will
happen which may have changed your mind but which you cannot control and which
it is too late to do anything about.  This is good, because it will prepare you
for being on the train, where you cannot control anything and the time to
change your mind was eight hundred miles ago at the last stop with an
airport.</p>
<p>First, you will learn, by calling Amtrak about another matter entirely, that on
account of this being the hottest summer ever recorded on Earth, a large fire
has severely burned a wooden rail trestle north of Sacramento.  Rather than
attempting to rush across the weakened trestle at speed, à la Phileas Fogg at
Medicine Bow, Amtrak is pleased to inform you that you will be put on a bus
instead.  Annoyance quickly turns to relief as you learn after this call that
the only possible rail detour involves going through Donner Pass.  You may not
know much about Donner Pass, but you do remember that it is not named after
people who were particularly successful in crossing it.</p>
<p>The friendly customer service representative will also inform you that because
of the coronavirus, only sleeping-car passengers will be able to eat real food
in the dining car.  You will be consigned to the café car.  This at first may
not sound so bad to you; after all, you like cafés.  Do not be deceived.</p>
<p>You will awake several days later to an email from Amtrak about a bus.  Not the
bus that will spare you from crossing Donner Pass, but another bus, running
from Boston to Albany and replacing the very first leg of your trip.  What the
email will not tell you is that the bus will be well air-conditioned and will
have a bus conductor, who will be exceptionally cheery and will hand out free
snacks at regular intervals.  Moreover, the bus will arrive early into Albany,
allowing you time to explore this gem of a city on the Hudson.</p>

<p>A few hours later, impressed by the ornate state capitol building and vaguely
disturbed by the Brutalist plaza it overlooks, you will with some relief board
the train, the Lake Shore Limited, and proceed uneventfully to Buffalo,
arriving shortly after midnight to a late-summer thunderstorm.</p>

<p>In the morning, you might wander around a Buffalo neighborhood, or visit the
historic, Olmsted-designed Delaware Park.  On the way, you might pass an
abandoned state hospital, which will make you start to wonder why so many
public buildings in upstate New York look like castles.  You might hope to find
an explanation later, but any such thoughts will soon be pushed from your mind,
because you will arrive at Niagara Falls.</p>
<center style="margin: 2em;"><img src="section_break.png" width=144 /></center>
<p>Being the sort of person who will take a two-week rail trip to avoid paying
higher airfares, you of course will not arrive in Niagara in style.  Rather,
you will probably haul yourself and all your luggage across town, where you
will catch a city bus that will deposit you an hour later in front of a
Fairfield Inn a few blocks from the visitor center.  But your fare of only $2
will make every minute worth it.</p>

<p>Having grown up nowhere nearby, you will struggle to comprehend that four of
the five Great Lakes are draining through this one point, pouring over this
cliff at an absolutely terrific rate (enough to fill your neighborhood swimming
pool in a tenth of a second).  But you must try to move past this and make sure
to get yourself to the Cave of the Winds, though not a cave, will still be
possibly the best thing you have done in a very long time.</p>
<p>A long, damp elevator ride will take you to a longer, damper tunnel, at the end
of which you will find a set of wooden platforms absolutely soaking in the
runoff of Bridal Veil Falls, which is now directly above you. The oversized
yellow ponchos and cheesy flip flops you wear will much improve the experience,
and you will find yourself uncontrollably laughing with complete strangers as
you surrender yourselves to the columns of spray bombarding you from 181 feet
above.</p>

<p>Reboarding the Lake Shore Limited at midnight, after watching the sun set over
Lake Erie, you will be faced with the first challenge of your trip: sleeping on
the train.  If you can sleep on airplanes, you will be pleasantly surprised.
If you cannot—well—you will be feeling less pleasant, especially if you make
the mistake of allowing yourself to be stuck in the aisle seat with nowhere to
rest your head.</p>
<p>The sunrise will wake you just as the train rolls into South Bend, which will
remind you of Pete Buttigieg and his upward failure to the top of the
Department of Transportation, which you suppose probably has something to do
with Amtrak.  This will not improve your mood, and you will be glad to finally
reach Chicago.</p>
<center style="margin: 2em;"><img src="section_break.png" width=144 /></center>
<p>Stepping off the train, you will smell pretzels, though you will not be sure
whether this is because you are in Chicago, or because you have had little
sleep and no breakfast and some part of your wants you to eat a giant pretzel.
The folks who set Amtrak’s timetables, who you will appreciate more and more as
your journey continues, have given you around five hours before your next train
leaves.  This is ample time to circle the Loop. And to do something about that
pretzel.</p>
