                <div class="excerpt">The race for president continues in these strange times, albeit with one candidate stuck in his basement. As the pandemic unfolded around us, the focus of the race shifted from the primaries to the general election, and while it’s a long way to November, Joe Biden has emerged as the polling leader and a moderate favorite to win the election, according to this site’s forecast.
There's been some discussion of Biden's fundraising gap with Donald Trump, and what it might mean for his prospects.</div>

This realignment process can provide valuable insight into the preferences of voters, and help us understand how the race might change if more candidates start to drop out.</div>

Mathematically, one way to understand these patterns is through Markov chains. Thinking of weather in this way can reveal some interesting patterns, and confirm some stereotypes.</div>
