      <description>Last week, Biden outspent Trump on Facebook by more than a 2-to-1 margin. But per-state spending has little to do with how competitive each state is, and everything to do with how many supportive voters live there.</description>

      <title>Not Just Like the Flu</title>

      <description>All of the numbers floating around about the coronavirus can obscure the one  simple fact that we must all remember if we are to be disciplined enough in our social distancing: this pandemic is deadly serious, and if we don’t continue to take drastic action, at an individual and societal level, then someone you know will probably die.</description>

      <title>The Nevada Caucuses</title>
      <link>https://corymccartan.github.io/2020/02/the-nevada-caucuses/</link>

      <description>Caucuses have a distinct advantage over primaries, which are conducted by ballot: after an initial tally of candidates’ support, voters can realign themselves into new groups before the final count. This realignment process can provide valuable insight into the preferences of voters, and help us understand how the race might change if more candidates start to drop out.</description>

      <title>On a Streak?</title>
      <link>https://corymccartan.github.io/2020/02/weather/</link>

      <description>Streaks are an important part of how we experience a place&amp;rsquo;s weather: it matters not just how hot it gets, or how much it rains, but also how long these kinds of weather stick around. Mathematically, one way to understand these patterns is through Markov chains. Thinking of weather in this way can reveal some interesting patterns, and confirm some stereotypes.</description>

      <description>While we’re all familiar with the usual red-blue map of state partisan preference, things get a little more interesting when we look at states&#39; views on economic and social issues separately.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The standard U.S. map shows states laid out in two dimensions, but doesn&amp;rsquo;t
convey any information about the crucial third dimension: altitude.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>37 Supreme Court Justices on a Plane</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The most common measure of Supreme Court justice ideology are the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://mqscores.lsa.umich.edu/&#34;&gt;Martin&amp;ndash;Quinn scores&lt;/a&gt;, developed by the
eponymous political scientists.  Since their &lt;a href=&#34;https://mqscores.lsa.umich.edu/media/pa02.pdf&#34;&gt;original publication in
2002&lt;/a&gt;, the scores have been
widely used, in political science and in the media, to place justices on
a left&amp;ndash;right political spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Corresponding to each point in and around the Mandelbrot set is a Julia set. If we start with a point near the origin, and move it in a circle around the main bulb of the Mandelbrot set, the series of corresponding Julia sets morph beautifully into one another.</description>
