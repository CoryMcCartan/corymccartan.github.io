      <description>I recently examined the political views of ordinary voters, and made a lot of comparisons across income groups, political parties, education, and race. One factor I didn&#39;t look at, though, was geography. While we’re all familiar with the usual red-blue map of state partisan preference, things get a little more interesting when we look at states&amp;rsquo; views on economic and social issues separately.
Read: Polarization and the American Electorate &amp;raquo;  Using data from the Cooperative Congressional Election Study, which asks voters about their views on a range of policy questions, we can assign each voter a social and economic score, ranging from –100 (most liberal) to 100 (most conservative).</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The standard U.S. map shows states laid out in two dimensions, but doesn&#39;t
convey any information about the crucial third dimension: altitude.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The most common measure of Supreme Court justice ideology are the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://mqscores.lsa.umich.edu/&#34;&gt;Martin&amp;ndash;Quinn scores&lt;/a&gt;, developed by the
eponymous political scientists.  Since their &lt;a href=&#34;https://mqscores.lsa.umich.edu/media/pa02.pdf&#34;&gt;original publication in
2002&lt;/a&gt;, the scores have been
widely used, in political science and in the media, to place justices on
a left&amp;ndash;right political spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Corresponding to each point in and around the Mandelbrot set is a Julia set. If we start with a point near the origin, and move it in a circle around the main bulb of the Mandelbrot set, the series of corresponding Julia sets morph beautifully into one another.</description>
