Abstract
</summary>
<p>
Political actors frequently manipulate redistricting plans to gain electoral
advantages, a process commonly known as gerrymandering. To address this
problem, several states have implemented institutional reforms including the
establishment of map-drawing commissions. It is difficult to assess the impact
of such reforms because each state structures bundles of complex rules in
different ways. We propose to model redistricting processes as a sequential
game. The equilibrium solution to the game summarizes multi-step institutional
interactions as a single dimensional score. This score measures the leeway
political actors have over the partisan lean of the final plan. Using a
differences-in-differences design, we demonstrate that reforms reduce partisan
bias and increase competitiveness when they constrain partisan actors. We
perform a counterfactual policy analysis to estimate the partisan effects of
enacting recent institutional reforms nationwide. We find that instituting
redistricting commissions generally reduces the current Republican advantage,
but Michigan-style reforms would yield a much greater pro-Democratic effect than
types of redistricting commissions adopted in Ohio and New York.

Abstract
</summary>
<p>
The estimation of racial disparities in various fields is often hampered by the
lack of individual-level racial information. In many cases, the law prohibits
the collection of such information to prevent direct racial discrimination. As
a result, analysts have frequently adopted Bayesian Improved Surname Geocoding
(BISG) and its variants, which combine individual names and addresses with
Census data to predict race. Unfortunately, the residuals of BISG are often
correlated with the outcomes of interest, generally attenuating estimates
of racial disparities. To correct this bias, we propose an alternative
identification strategy under the assumption that surname is conditionally
independent of the outcome given (unobserved) race, residence location, and
other observed characteristics. We introduce a new class of models, Bayesian
Instrumental Regression for Disparity Estimation (BIRDiE), that take BISG
probabilities as inputs and produce racial disparity estimates by using surnames
as an instrumental variable for race. Our estimation method is scalable, making
it possible to analyze large-scale administrative data. We also show how to
address potential violations of the key identification assumptions. A validation
study based on the North Carolina voter file shows that BISG+BIRDiE reduces
error by up to 84% when estimating racial differences in party registration.
Finally, we apply the proposed methodology to estimate racial differences in who
benefits from the home mortgage interest deduction using individual-level tax
data from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. Open-source software is available
which implements the proposed methodology.

Abstract
</summary>
<p>
Social scientists have developed dozens of measures for assessing partisan bias
in redistricting. But these measures cannot be easily adapted to other groups,
including those defined by race, class, or geography. Nor are they applicable
to single- or no-party contexts such as local redistricting. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a unified framework of *harm* for evaluating the impacts
of a districting plan on individual voters and the groups to which they belong.
We consider a voter harmed if their chosen candidate is not elected under the
current plan, but would be under a different plan. Harm improves on existing
measures by both focusing on the choices of individual voters and directly
incorporating counterfactual plans. We discuss strategies for estimating harm,
and demonstrate the utility of our framework through analyses of partisan
gerrymandering in New Jersey, voting rights litigation in Alabama, and racial
dynamics of Boston City Council elections.

Abstract
</summary>
<p>
A recurring challenge in the application of redistricting simulation algorithms
lies in extracting useful summaries and comparisons from a large ensemble
of districting plans. Researchers often compute summary statistics for each
district in a plan, and then study their distribution across the plans in the
ensemble. This approach discards rich geographic information that is inherent
in districting plans. We introduce the projective average, an operation that
projects a district-level summary statistic back to the underlying geography
and then averages this statistic across plans in the ensemble. Compared to
traditional district-level summaries, projective averages are a powerful tool
for geographically granular, sub-district analysis of districting plans along
a variety of dimensions. However, care must be taken to account for variation
within redistricting ensembles, to avoid misleading conclusions. We propose and
validate a multiple-testing procedure to control the probability of incorrectly
identifying outlier plans or regions when using projective averages.

Abstract

<p>
Redistricting practitioners must balance many competing constraints and criteria
when drawing district boundaries. To aid in this process, researchers have
developed many methods for optimizing districting plans according to one or
more criteria. This research note extends a recently-proposed single-criterion
optimization method, short bursts (Cannon et al., 2023), to handle the
multi-criterion case, and in doing so approximate the Pareto frontier for
any set of constraints. We study the empirical performance of the method in
a realistic setting and find it behaves as expected and is not very sensitive
to algorithmic parameters. The proposed approach, which is implemented in
open-source software, should allow researchers and practitioners to better
understand the tradeoffs inherent to the redistricting process.

The United States Census Bureau faces a difficult trade-off between the
accuracy of Census statistics and the protection of individual information.
We conduct the first independent evaluation of bias and noise induced by the
Bureau's two main disclosure avoidance systems: the TopDown algorithm employed
for the 2020 Census and the swapping algorithm implemented for the 1990, 2000,
and 2010 Censuses. Our evaluation leverages the recent release of the Noisy
Measure File (NMF) as well as the availability of two independent runs of the
TopDown algorithm applied to the 2010 decennial Census. We find that the NMF
contains too much noise to be directly useful alone, especially for Hispanic
and multiracial populations. TopDown's post-processing dramatically reduces the
NMF noise and produces similarly accurate data to swapping in terms of bias and
noise. These patterns hold across census geographies with varying population
sizes and racial diversity. While the estimated errors for both TopDown and
swapping are generally no larger than other sources of Census error, they can be
relatively substantial for geographies with small total populations.

Granular geographic data present new opportunities to understand how
neighborhoods are formed, and how they influence politics. At the same time,
the inherent subjectivity of neighborhoods creates methodological challenges
in measuring and modeling them. We develop an open-source survey instrument
that allows respondents to draw their neighborhoods on a map. We also propose
a statistical model to analyze how the characteristics of respondents and local
areas determine subjective neighborhoods. We conduct two surveys: collecting
subjective neighborhoods from voters in Miami, New York City, and Phoenix, and
asking New York City residents to draw a community of interest for inclusion
in their city council district. Our analysis shows that, holding other factors
constant, White respondents include census blocks with more White residents
in their neighborhoods. Similarly, Democrats and Republicans are more likely
to include co-partisan areas. Furthermore, our model provides more accurate
out-of-sample predictions than standard neighborhood measures.

The U.S. Census Bureau collects and publishes detailed demographic data about
Americans which are heavily used by researchers and policymakers. The Bureau
has recently adopted the framework of differential privacy in an effort
to improve confidentiality of individual census responses. A key output of
this privacy protection system is the Noisy Measurement File (NMF), which is
produced by adding random noise to tabulated statistics. The NMF is critical
to understanding any biases in the data, and performing valid statistical
inference on published census data. Unfortunately, the current release format
of the NMF is difficult to access and work with. We describe the process we
use to transform the NMF into a usable format, and provide recommendations to
the Bureau for how to release future versions of the NMF. These changes are
essential for ensuring transparency of privacy measures and reproducibility of
scientific research built on census data.

<p>
Random sampling of graph partitions under constraints has become a popular
tool for evaluating legislative redistricting plans. Analysts detect partisan
gerrymandering by comparing a proposed redistricting plan with an ensemble
of sampled alternative plans. For successful application, sampling methods
must scale to large maps with many districts, incorporate realistic legal
constraints, and accurately and efficiently sample from a selected target
distribution. Unfortunately, most existing methods struggle in at least one
of these areas. We present a new Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) algorithm that
generates a sample of redistricting plans converging to a realistic target
distribution. Because it draws many plans in parallel, the SMC algorithm
can efficiently explore the relevant space of redistricting plans better
than the existing Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms that generate
plans sequentially. Our algorithm can simultaneously incorporate several
constraints commonly imposed in real-world redistricting problems, including
equal population, compactness, and preservation of administrative boundaries.
We validate the accuracy of the proposed algorithm by using a small map where
all redistricting plans can be enumerated. We then apply the SMC algorithm to
evaluate the partisan implications of several maps submitted by relevant parties
in a recent high-profile redistricting case in the state of Pennsylvania. We
find that the proposed algorithm converges to the target distribution faster and
with fewer samples than a state-of-the-art MCMC algorithm. Open-source software
is available for implementing the proposed methodology.

<p>
Congressional district lines in many U.S. states are drawn by partisan actors,
raising concerns about gerrymandering. To isolate the electoral impact of
gerrymandering from the effects of other factors including geography and
redistricting rules, we compare predicted election outcomes under the enacted
plan with those under a large sample of non-partisan, simulated alternative
plans for all states. We find that partisan gerrymandering is widespread
in the 2020 redistricting cycle, but most of the bias it creates cancels at
the national level, giving Republicans two additional seats, on average. In
contrast, moderate pro-Republican bias due to geography and redistricting
rules remains. Finally, we find that partisan gerrymandering reduces electoral
competition and makes the House's partisan composition less responsive to shifts
in the national vote.

<p>
The output of predictive models is routinely recalibrated by reconciling
low-level predictions with known quantities defined at higher levels of
aggregation. For example, models predicting vote probabilities at the individual
level in U.S. elections can be adjusted so that their aggregation matches
the observed vote totals in each county, thus producing better calibrated
predictions. In this research note, we provide theoretical grounding for one
of the most commonly used recalibration strategies, known colloquially as
the "logit shift." Typically cast as a heuristic adjustment strategy (whereby
a constant correction on the logit scale is found, such that aggregated
predictions match target totals), we show that the logit shift offers a fast
and accurate approximation to a principled, but computationally impractical
adjustment strategy: computing the posterior prediction probabilities,
conditional on the observed totals. After deriving analytical bounds on the
quality of the approximation, we illustrate its accuracy using Monte Carlo
simulations. We also discuss scenarios in which the logit shift is less
effective at recalibrating predictions: when the target totals are defined
only for highly heterogeneous populations, and when the original predictions
correctly capture the mean of true individual probabilities, but fail to capture
the shape of their distribution.

<p>
In "Differential Perspectives: Epistemic Disconnects Surrounding the US Census
Bureau's Use of Differential Privacy," boyd and Sarathy argue that empirical
evaluations of the Census Disclosure Avoidance System (DAS), including our
published analysis, failed to recognize how the benchmark data against which
the 2020 DAS was evaluated is never a ground truth of population counts. In
this commentary, we explain why policy evaluation, which was the main goal of
our analysis, is still meaningful without access to a perfect ground truth. We
also point out that our evaluation leveraged features specific to the decennial
Census and redistricting data, such as block-level population invariance under
swapping and voter file racial identification, better approximating a comparison
with the ground truth. Lastly, we show that accurate statistical predictions
of individual race based on the Bayesian Improved Surname Geocoding, while not
a violation of differential privacy, substantially increases the disclosure
risk of private information the Census Bureau sought to protect. We conclude by
arguing that policy makers must confront a key trade-off between data utility
and privacy protection, and an epistemic disconnect alone is insufficient to
explain disagreements between policy choices.

A collection of simulated congressional districting plans and underlying

Project. The data allow for the evaluation of enacted and other congressional
redistricting plans in the United States. While the use of redistricting
simulation algorithms has become standard in academic research and court
cases, any simulation analysis requires non-trivial efforts to combine multiple
data sets, identify state-specific redistricting criteria, implement complex
simulation algorithms, and summarize and visualize simulation outputs. We
have developed a complete workflow that facilitates this entire process of
simulation-based redistricting analysis for the congressional districts of all
50 states. The resulting data include ensembles of simulated 2020 congressional
redistricting plans and necessary replication data. We provide the underlying
code, which serves as a template for customized analyses. All data and code are

Abstract
</summary>
<p>
Census statistics play a key role in public policy decisions and social
science research. However, given the risk of revealing individual information,
many statistical agencies are considering disclosure control methods based
on differential privacy, which add noise to tabulated data. Unlike other
applications of differential privacy, however, census statistics must be
postprocessed after noise injection to be usable. We study the impact of
the U.S. Census Bureau's latest disclosure avoidance system (DAS) on a major
application of census statistics, the redrawing of electoral districts. We
find that the DAS systematically undercounts the population in mixed-race and
mixed-partisan precincts, yielding unpredictable racial and partisan biases.
While the DAS leads to a likely violation of the "One Person, One Vote"
standard as currently interpreted, it does not prevent accurate predictions of
an individual's race and ethnicity. Our findings underscore the difficulty of
balancing accuracy and respondent privacy in the Census.

Abstract

<p>
We study the analogue of a convex interpolant of two sets on Sierpiński gaskets
and an associated notion of measure transport. The structure of a natural
family of interpolating measures is described and an interpolation inequality
is established. A key tool is a good description of geodesics on these gaskets,
some results on which have previously appeared in the literature.

Summary
</summary>
<p>
Congestion is increasing in cities around the country, and particularly
in the Seattle region. Local governments are increasingly experimenting
with congestion pricing schemes to manage congestion. The Washington State
Department of Transportation (WSDOT) opened a congestion pricing facility in
2015 on I-405, which runs through the eastern suburbs of Seattle. The facility
operates by selling extra space in the high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes to
single-occupancy vehicles (SOVs), and dynamically changing the price of entry
to manage demand and keep the lanes operating. These combined HOV and tolled SOV
lanes are called High Occupancy Tolling (HOT) lanes.
</p>
<p>
While the HOT lanes have been operative for over three years, there has been
little research into the equity impacts of the lanes. Using data on each trip
made on the I-405 HOT lanes in 2018, demographic data on census block groups,
and lane speed, volume, and travel time data, we tried to answer this question.
We studied how the express toll lanes are used, the benefits they provide to the
region, and how these benefits are distributed among different groups of users.
