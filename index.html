<p>
Social scientists have developed dozens of measures for assessing partisan bias
in redistricting. But these measures cannot be easily adapted to other groups,
including those defined by race, class, or geography. Nor are they applicable
to single- or no-party contexts such as local redistricting. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a unified framework of <i>harm</i> for evaluating the impacts
of a districting plan on individual voters and the groups to which they belong.
We consider a voter harmed if their chosen candidate is not elected under the
current plan, but would be under a different plan. Harm improves on existing
measures by both focusing on the choices of individual voters and directly
incorporating counterfactual plans. We discuss strategies for estimating harm,
and demonstrate the utility of our framework through analyses of partisan
gerrymandering in New Jersey, voting rights litigation in Alabama, and racial
dynamics of Boston City Council elections.

Random sampling of graph partitions under constraints has become a popular tool
for evaluating legislative redistricting plans. Analysts detect partisan
gerrymandering by comparing a proposed redistricting plan with an ensemble
of sampled alternative plans. For successful application, sampling methods
must scale to large maps with many districts, incorporate realistic legal
constraints, and accurately and efficiently sample from a selected target
distribution. Unfortunately, most existing methods struggle in at least one
of these areas. We present a new Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) algorithm
that generates a sample of redistricting plans converging to a realistic
target distribution. Because it draws many plans in parallel, the SMC
algorithm can efficiently explore the relevant space of redistricting plans
better than the existing Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms that
generate plans sequentially. Our algorithm can simultaneously incorporate
several constraints commonly imposed in real-world redistricting problems,
including equal population, compactness, and preservation of administrative
boundaries. We validate the accuracy of the proposed algorithm by using a
small map where all redistricting plans can be enumerated. We then apply
the SMC algorithm to evaluate the partisan implications of several maps
submitted by relevant parties in a recent high-profile redistricting case
in the state of Pennsylvania. We find that the proposed algorithm converges
to the target distribution faster and with fewer samples than a
state-of-the-art MCMC algorithm. Open-source software is available for
implementing the proposed methodology.

<p>
Census statistics play a key role in public policy decisions and social science
research. However, given the risk of revealing individual information, many
statistical agencies are considering disclosure control methods based on
differential privacy, which add noise to tabulated data. Unlike other
applications of differential privacy, however, census statistics must be
postprocessed after noise injection to be usable. We study the impact of the
U.S. Census Bureau’s latest disclosure avoidance system (DAS) on a major
application of census statistics, the redrawing of electoral districts. We find
that the DAS systematically undercounts the population in mixed-race and
mixed-partisan precincts, yielding unpredictable racial and partisan biases.
While the DAS leads to a likely violation of the “One Person, One Vote”
standard as currently interpreted, it does not prevent accurate predictions of
an individual’s race and ethnicity. Our findings underscore the difficulty of
balancing accuracy and respondent privacy in the Census.

With the availability of granular geographical data, social scientists are
increasingly interested in examining how residential neighborhoods are formed
and how they influence attitudes and behavior. To facilitate such studies, we
develop an easy-to-use online survey instrument that allows respondents to draw
their neighborhoods on a map. We then propose a statistical model to analyze
how the characteristics of respondents, relevant local areas, and their
interactions shape subjective neighborhoods. The model also generates
out-of-sample predictions of one's neighborhood given these observed
characteristics. We illustrate the proposed methodology by conducting a survey
among registered voters in Miami, New York City, and Phoenix. We find that
across these cities voters are more likely to include same-race and co-partisan
census blocks in their neighborhoods. Net of other factors, White respondents
are 6.1 to 16.9 percentage points more likely to include in their neighborhoods
a census block composed entirely of White residents compared to one with no
White residents. Similarly, Democratic and Republican respondents are 8.6 to
19.2 percentage points more likely to include an entirely co-partisan census
block compared to one consisting entirely of out-partisans. Co-partisanship
exhibits a similar, independent, influence. We also show that our model
provides more accurate out-of-sample predictions than the standard
distance-based measures of neighborhoods. Open-source software is available for
implementing the proposed methodology.

<p>
Congressional district lines in many U.S. states are drawn by partisan actors,
raising concerns about gerrymandering. To isolate the electoral impact of
gerrymandering from the effects of other factors including geography and
redistricting rules, we compare predicted election outcomes under the enacted
plan with those under a large sample of non-partisan, simulated alternative
plans for all states. We find that partisan gerrymandering is widespread in the
2020 redistricting cycle, but most of the bias it creates cancels at the
national level, giving Republicans two additional seats, on average. In
contrast, moderate pro-Republican bias due to geography and redistricting rules
remains. Finally, we find that partisan gerrymandering reduces electoral
competition and makes the House's partisan composition less responsive to
shifts in the national vote.

A collection of simulated congressional districting plans and underlying code
developed by the Algorithm-Assisted Redistricting Methodology 
(ALARM) Project. The data allow for the evaluation of enacted and other congressional 
redistricting plans in the United States.  While the use of redistricting
simulation algorithms has become standard in academic research and court cases,
any simulation analysis requires non-trivial efforts to combine multiple data
sets, identify state-specific redistricting criteria, implement complex
simulation algorithms, and summarize and visualize simulation outputs.  We have
developed a complete workflow that facilitates this entire process of
simulation-based redistricting analysis for the congressional districts of all
50 states.  The resulting data include ensembles of simulated 2020
congressional redistricting plans and necessary replication data.  We provide
the underlying code, which serves as a template for customized analyses.  All
data and code are free and publicly available.

<p>
In "Differential Perspectives: Epistemic Disconnects Surrounding the US Census Bureau's Use of Differential Privacy," boyd and Sarathy argue that empirical evaluations of the Census Disclosure Avoidance System (DAS), including our published analysis, failed to recognize how the benchmark data against which the 2020 DAS was evaluated is never a ground truth of population counts.
In this commentary, we explain why policy evaluation, which was the main goal of our analysis, is still meaningful without access to a perfect ground truth.
We also point out that our evaluation leveraged features specific to the decennial Census and redistricting data, such as block-level population invariance under swapping and voter file racial identification, better approximating a comparison with the ground truth.
Lastly, we show that accurate statistical predictions of individual race based on the Bayesian Improved Surname Geocoding, while not a violation of differential privacy, substantially increases the disclosure risk of private information the Census Bureau sought to protect.
We conclude by arguing that policy makers must confront a key trade-off between data utility and privacy protection, and an epistemic disconnect alone is insufficient to explain disagreements between policy choices.

<p><strong>Recalibration Of Predicted Probabilities Using the “Logit Shift”: Why does it work, and when can it be expected to work well?</strong>

<p>
The output of predictive models is routinely recalibrated by reconciling
low-level predictions with known quantities defined at higher levels of
aggregation. For example, models predicting vote probabilities at the
individual level in U.S. elections can be adjusted so that their aggregation
matches the observed vote totals in each county, thus producing better
calibrated predictions. In this research note, we provide theoretical grounding
for one of the most commonly used recalibration strategies, known colloquially
as the “logit shift.” Typically cast as a heuristic adjustment strategy
(whereby a constant correction on the logit scale is found, such that
aggregated predictions match target totals), we show that the logit shift
offers a fast and accurate approximation to a principled, but
computationally impractical adjustment strategy: computing the posterior
prediction probabilities, conditional on the observed totals. After
deriving analytical bounds on the quality of the approximation, we
illustrate its accuracy using Monte Carlo simulations. We also discuss
scenarios in which the logit shift is less effective at recalibrating
predictions: when the target totals are defined only for highly
heterogeneous populations, and when the original predictions correctly
capture the mean of true individual probabilities, but fail to capture the
shape of their distribution.

Bayesian Improved Surname Geocoding (BISG) is widely used to provide estimates
of racial disparities from microdata that do not contain individual race
information.  However, in most applications, the existing approach to
estimating these disparities relies on an implausible independence assumption.
We provide an alternative identifying assumption and develop a Bayesian model
that can provide accurate estimates of racial disparities. We apply the
proposed method to the problem of estimating party identification by race in
North Carolina and find that it improves significantly on the existing approach.

<p>
Congestion is increasing in cities around the country, and particularly in the
Seattle region. Local governments are increasingly experimenting with
congestion pricing schemes to manage congestion. The Washington State
Department of Transportation (WSDOT) opened a congestion pricing facility in
2015 on I-405, which runs through the eastern suburbs of Seattle. The facility
operates by selling extra space in the high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes to
single-occupancy vehicles (SOVs), and dynamically changing the price of entry
to manage demand and keep the lanes operating. These combined HOV and tolled
SOV lanes are called High Occupancy Tolling (HOT) lanes.
</p>
<p>
While the HOT lanes have been operative for over three years, there has been
little research into the equity impacts of the lanes. Using data on each trip
made on the I-405 HOT lanes in 2018, demographic data on census block groups,
and lane speed, volume, and travel time data, we tried to answer this question.
We studied how the express toll lanes are used, the benefits they provide to
the region, and how these benefits are distributed among different groups of
users.
