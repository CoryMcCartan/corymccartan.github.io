<p>
The estimation of racial disparities in health care, financial services,
voting, and other contexts is often hampered by the lack of individual-level
racial information in administrative records. In many cases, the law prohibits
the collection of such information to prevent direct racial discrimination. As
a result, many analysts have adopted Bayesian Improved Surname Geocoding
(BISG), which combines individual names and addresses with the Census data to
predict race. Although BISG tends to produce well-calibrated racial
predictions, its residuals are often correlated with the outcomes of interest,
yielding biased estimates of racial disparities. We propose an alternative
identification strategy that corrects this bias. The proposed strategy is
applicable whenever one's surname is conditionally independent of the outcome
given their (unobserved) race, residence location, and other observed
characteristics. Leveraging this identification strategy, we introduce a new
class of models, Bayesian Instrumental Regression for Disparity Estimation
(BIRDiE), that estimate racial disparities by using surnames as a
high-dimensional instrumental variable for race. Our estimation method is
scalable, making it possible to analyze large-scale administrative data. We
also show how to address potential violations of the key identification
assumptions. A validation study based on the North Carolina voter file shows
that BIRDiE reduces error by up to 84% in comparison to the standard approaches
for estimating racial differences in party registration. Open-source software
is available which implements the proposed methodology.

Social scientists have developed dozens of measures for assessing partisan bias
in redistricting. But these measures cannot be easily adapted to other groups,
including those defined by race, class, or geography. Nor are they applicable
to single- or no-party contexts such as local redistricting. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a unified framework of <i>harm</i> for evaluating the impacts
of a districting plan on individual voters and the groups to which they belong.
We consider a voter harmed if their chosen candidate is not elected under the
current plan, but would be under a different plan. Harm improves on existing
measures by both focusing on the choices of individual voters and directly
incorporating counterfactual plans. We discuss strategies for estimating harm,
and demonstrate the utility of our framework through analyses of partisan
gerrymandering in New Jersey, voting rights litigation in Alabama, and racial
dynamics of Boston City Council elections.

Granular geographic data present new opportunities to understand how
neighborhoods are formed, and how they influence politics. At the same time,
the inherent subjectivity of neighborhoods creates methodological challenges in
measuring and modeling them. We develop a survey instrument that allows
respondents to draw their neighborhoods on a map. We also propose a statistical
model to analyze how the characteristics of respondents and local areas
determine subjective neighborhoods. We conduct two surveys: collecting
subjective neighborhoods from voters in Miami, New York City, and Phoenix, and
asking New York City residents to draw a community of interest for inclusion in
their city council district. Our analysis shows that, holding other factors
constant, White respondents include census blocks with more White residents in
their neighborhoods. Similarly, Democrats and Republicans are more likely to
include co-partisan areas. In addition, our model provides more accurate
out-of-sample predictions than standard neighborhood measures.

<p>
The United States Census Bureau faces a difficult trade-off between the
accuracy of Census statistics and the protection of individual information. We
conduct the first independent evaluation of bias and noise induced by the
Bureau's two main disclosure avoidance systems: the TopDown algorithm employed
for the 2020 Census and the swapping algorithm implemented for the 1990, 2000,
and 2010 Censuses. Our evaluation leverages the recent release of the Noisy
Measure File (NMF) as well as the availability of two independent runs of
the TopDown algorithm applied to the 2010 decennial Census. We find that
the NMF contains too much noise to be directly useful alone, especially for
Hispanic and multiracial populations. TopDown's post-processing
dramatically reduces the NMF noise and produces similarly accurate data to
swapping in terms of bias and noise. These patterns hold across census
geographies with varying population sizes and racial diversity. While the
estimated errors for both TopDown and swapping are generally no larger than
other sources of Census error, they can be relatively substantial for
geographies with small total populations.

<p>
The U.S. Census Bureau collects and publishes detailed demographic data about
Americans which are heavily used by researchers and policymakers. The Bureau
has recently adopted the framework of differential privacy in an effort to
improve confidentiality of individual census responses. A key output of this
privacy protection system is the Noisy Measurement File (NMF), which is
produced by adding random noise to tabulated statistics. The NMF is critical to
understanding any biases in the data, and performing valid statistical
inference on published census data. Unfortunately, the current release format
of the NMF is difficult to access and work with. We describe the process we use
to transform the NMF into a usable format, and provide recommendations to the
Bureau for how to release future versions of the NMF. These changes are
essential for ensuring transparency of privacy measures and reproducibility of
scientific research built on census data.

Redistricting practitioners must balance many competing constraints and
criteria when drawing district boundaries. To aid in this process, researchers
have developed many methods for optimizing districting plans according to one
or more criteria. This research note extends a recently-proposed
single-criterion optimization method, short bursts (Cannon et al., 2023), to
handle the multi-criterion case, and in doing so approximate the Pareto
frontier for any set of constraints. We study the empirical performance of the
method in a realistic setting and find it behaves as expected and is not very
sensitive to algorithmic parameters. The proposed approach, which is
implemented in open-source software, should allow researchers and practitioners
to better understand the tradeoffs inherent to the redistricting process.

Random sampling of graph partitions under constraints has become a popular tool
for evaluating legislative redistricting plans. Analysts detect partisan
gerrymandering by comparing a proposed redistricting plan with an ensemble
of sampled alternative plans. For successful application, sampling methods
must scale to large maps with many districts, incorporate realistic legal
constraints, and accurately and efficiently sample from a selected target
distribution. Unfortunately, most existing methods struggle in at least one
of these areas. We present a new Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) algorithm
that generates a sample of redistricting plans converging to a realistic
target distribution. Because it draws many plans in parallel, the SMC
algorithm can efficiently explore the relevant space of redistricting plans
better than the existing Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms that
generate plans sequentially. Our algorithm can simultaneously incorporate
several constraints commonly imposed in real-world redistricting problems,
including equal population, compactness, and preservation of administrative
boundaries. We validate the accuracy of the proposed algorithm by using a
small map where all redistricting plans can be enumerated. We then apply
the SMC algorithm to evaluate the partisan implications of several maps
submitted by relevant parties in a recent high-profile redistricting case
in the state of Pennsylvania. We find that the proposed algorithm converges
to the target distribution faster and with fewer samples than a
state-of-the-art MCMC algorithm. Open-source software is available for
implementing the proposed methodology.

Congressional district lines in many U.S. states are drawn by partisan actors,
raising concerns about gerrymandering. To isolate the electoral impact of
gerrymandering from the effects of other factors including geography and
redistricting rules, we compare predicted election outcomes under the enacted
plan with those under a large sample of non-partisan, simulated alternative
plans for all states. We find that partisan gerrymandering is widespread in the
2020 redistricting cycle, but most of the bias it creates cancels at the
national level, giving Republicans two additional seats, on average. In
contrast, moderate pro-Republican bias due to geography and redistricting rules
remains. Finally, we find that partisan gerrymandering reduces electoral
competition and makes the House's partisan composition less responsive to
shifts in the national vote.

Census statistics play a key role in public policy decisions and social science
research. However, given the risk of revealing individual information, many
statistical agencies are considering disclosure control methods based on
differential privacy, which add noise to tabulated data. Unlike other
applications of differential privacy, however, census statistics must be
postprocessed after noise injection to be usable. We study the impact of the
U.S. Census Bureau’s latest disclosure avoidance system (DAS) on a major
application of census statistics, the redrawing of electoral districts. We find
that the DAS systematically undercounts the population in mixed-race and
mixed-partisan precincts, yielding unpredictable racial and partisan biases.
While the DAS leads to a likely violation of the “One Person, One Vote”
standard as currently interpreted, it does not prevent accurate predictions of
an individual’s race and ethnicity. Our findings underscore the difficulty of
balancing accuracy and respondent privacy in the Census.

A collection of simulated congressional districting plans and underlying code

any simulation analysis requires non-trivial efforts to combine multiple data

developed a complete workflow that facilitates this entire process of
simulation-based redistricting analysis for the congressional districts of all

<p>
In "Differential Perspectives: Epistemic Disconnects Surrounding the US Census Bureau's Use of Differential Privacy," boyd and Sarathy argue that empirical evaluations of the Census Disclosure Avoidance System (DAS), including our published analysis, failed to recognize how the benchmark data against which the 2020 DAS was evaluated is never a ground truth of population counts.
In this commentary, we explain why policy evaluation, which was the main goal of our analysis, is still meaningful without access to a perfect ground truth.
We also point out that our evaluation leveraged features specific to the decennial Census and redistricting data, such as block-level population invariance under swapping and voter file racial identification, better approximating a comparison with the ground truth.
Lastly, we show that accurate statistical predictions of individual race based on the Bayesian Improved Surname Geocoding, while not a violation of differential privacy, substantially increases the disclosure risk of private information the Census Bureau sought to protect.
We conclude by arguing that policy makers must confront a key trade-off between data utility and privacy protection, and an epistemic disconnect alone is insufficient to explain disagreements between policy choices.

<p>
The output of predictive models is routinely recalibrated by reconciling
low-level predictions with known quantities defined at higher levels of
aggregation. For example, models predicting vote probabilities at the
individual level in U.S. elections can be adjusted so that their aggregation
matches the observed vote totals in each county, thus producing better
calibrated predictions. In this research note, we provide theoretical grounding
for one of the most commonly used recalibration strategies, known colloquially
as the “logit shift.” Typically cast as a heuristic adjustment strategy
(whereby a constant correction on the logit scale is found, such that
aggregated predictions match target totals), we show that the logit shift
offers a fast and accurate approximation to a principled, but
computationally impractical adjustment strategy: computing the posterior
prediction probabilities, conditional on the observed totals. After
deriving analytical bounds on the quality of the approximation, we
illustrate its accuracy using Monte Carlo simulations. We also discuss
scenarios in which the logit shift is less effective at recalibrating
predictions: when the target totals are defined only for highly
heterogeneous populations, and when the original predictions correctly
capture the mean of true individual probabilities, but fail to capture the
shape of their distribution.

<br />
2020 Census data is delayed and affected by differential privacy. This package
uses FCC block-level population estimates from 2010–2019, which are based on
new roads and map data, along with decennial Census and ACS data, to estimate
2020 block populations, both overall and by major race/ethnicity categories
(using iterative proportional fitting).</p>

<summary>Project summary</summary>
<p>
Congestion is increasing in cities around the country, and particularly in the
Seattle region. Local governments are increasingly experimenting with
congestion pricing schemes to manage congestion. The Washington State
Department of Transportation (WSDOT) opened a congestion pricing facility in
2015 on I-405, which runs through the eastern suburbs of Seattle. The facility
operates by selling extra space in the high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes to
single-occupancy vehicles (SOVs), and dynamically changing the price of entry
to manage demand and keep the lanes operating. These combined HOV and tolled
SOV lanes are called High Occupancy Tolling (HOT) lanes.
</p>
<p>
While the HOT lanes have been operative for over three years, there has been
little research into the equity impacts of the lanes. Using data on each trip
made on the I-405 HOT lanes in 2018, demographic data on census block groups,
and lane speed, volume, and travel time data, we tried to answer this question.
We studied how the express toll lanes are used, the benefits they provide to
the region, and how these benefits are distributed among different groups of
users.
