<p><span class="leadin">On Saturday, tens of thousands</span> of Nevadans gathered
in classrooms, libraries, and gyms to take part in one of only four mainland
caucuses of the 2020 presidential race. While
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/22/us/politics/nevada-results-delay.html">new party rules</a>
have slowed the reporting of caucus results, caucuses do have a distinct advantage
over primaries, which are conducted by ballot: after an initial tally of
candidates’ support, voters can realign themselves into new groups before
the final count and avoid “wasting” their vote on an unviable
candidate. This realignment process can provide valuable insight into the
preferences of voters, and help us understand how the race might change if more
candidates start to drop out.</p>
<p>Not every voter can realign. After the first round of voting, candidates who
don&rsquo;t have at least 15% of the vote are deemed &ldquo;unviable.&rdquo; Supporters of
unviable candidates can switch to caucus for viable candidates, or can try to
join with supporters of other unviable candidates to make at least one of the
unviable candidates viable again. Supporters of viable candidates cannot
change their vote. (Words aren&rsquo;t the best way to explain it; there are some
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/02/20/us/politics/how-nevada-caucuses-work.html">great visuals</a>
that do much better.) The chart below shows the fraction of precincts that
each candidate was viable at; Sanders leads the pack by a wide margin here,
viable at over four in five precincts. (All data here come from the 88% of
reporting precincts, as of Sunday night.)</p>
<figure class="w6in"><img src="prop_viable.png"/>
</figure>

<p>Each precinct reports the total number of votes at the first round and the
final round after realignment, so we know which candidates gained or lost
support.  Across the whole state, Sanders, Biden, and Buttigieg gained support
during the realignment phase, while the other candidates lost it (because they
weren&rsquo;t viable at most precincts).  What we don&rsquo;t know, however, is individual
voters&rsquo; realignment choices.  What kind of voters switched to Sanders? Were they
Warren supporters? Biden supporters? A mix?</p>
<figure class="w5in"><img src="round_shares.png"/>
</figure>

<p>This is where statistics comes in. Given the large number of precincts, nearly
every combination of viable and unviable candidates happened somewhere.  This
means that we can estimate which candidates voters switch to once their
preferred candidate is no longer an option.</p>
<p>For example, if in Precinct A all candidates but Sanders and Biden are viable,
but in Precinct B all candidates but Warren and Biden are viable, we can
compare the realignment numbers between the precincts A and B to say something
about how Biden voters realign themselves.  (To do this, we have to
<a href="#assumptions">make some assumptions</a>.)</p>
<p>The results, shown below, are not too surprising. In places Sanders wasn&rsquo;t
viable, his supporters mostly went to Warren and Buttigieg. Where Klobuchar
and Steyer weren&rsquo;t viable, few of their supporters switched to Sanders.
Supporters of minor candidates like Tulsi Gabbard or Michael Bennet
overwhelmingly supported Buttigieg after realignment.</p>
<figure class="w7in"><img src="first_second.png"/>
</figure>

<p>What may be surprising is how much variation there is.  Candidates&rsquo; supporters
aren&rsquo;t a monolithic bloc, with similar second choices. Sanders&rsquo; supporters,
for instance, appear to be equally likely to switch to Buttigieg or Warren,
despite the major ideological differences between the two (and the similarities
between Warren&rsquo;s and Sanders&rsquo; platforms).</p>
<p>Importantly, since Bloomberg wasn&rsquo;t on the ballot in Nevada, he doesn&rsquo;t show up
in any of these analyses.  Past South Carolina, many voters&rsquo; second choice
candidate would be Bloomberg, and so these results can only give a partial
picture of the realignment dynamics.</p>
<p>But if we ignore Bloomberg for the moment, it&rsquo;s natural to wonder what these
preferences imply about how the race would change if a candidate were to drop
out. The chart below shows each possibility.</p>
<figure class="w5in"><img src="poll_chg.png"/>
</figure>

<p>Even if one of the leading centrists drops out, their voters wouldn&rsquo;t migrate
to the other centrists in enough numbers to push any centrist above Sanders.
But if Sanders were to drop out, it appears that Warren would be able to take
the lead in the national race.</p>
<p>Of course, estimates like these are incredibly speculative, even ignoring the
absence of Bloomberg.  A race in which Sanders drops out but Warren does not
would likely be a very different one, and the preferences of Nevada voters
shouldn&rsquo;t be considered very informative.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the few caucuses in this race, and their viability threshold and
subsequent realignments, provide unique insight into voters&rsquo; preferences beyond
their first choice.  Pollsters can and do ask questions to probe at this, but
these questions are speculative in a way that caucuses are not&mdash;at a caucus,
voters <em>must</em> choose a new candidate to support if theirs is eliminated. The
results from Nevada underscore both Sanders&rsquo; strength and also the fluidity
of the race.  Voters&rsquo; second choices don&rsquo;t clearly fall along ideological
lines.  No one knows what will happen when candidates start to leave the race.</p>
<div class="spacer" style="height: 1in"></div>
<h3 id="assumptions">Assumptions</h3>
<p>To estimate realignments, we have to assume that supporters of one unviable
candidate realign themselves independent of how the supporters of another
unviable candidate realign themselves. We also have to assume that supporters of
a candidate at a precinct where that candidate <em>isn&rsquo;t</em> viable don&rsquo;t have
different preferences than supporters of that candidate at a precinct where
they <em>are</em> viable.</p>
<p>Neither of these assumptions holds exactly, and the first one in particular is
questionable if there is a lot of horse-trading and strategic realignment,
which can happen at some caucuses.  For that reason, we exclude all caucus
locations where a candidate who is not viable in the first round becomes viable
again in the second round (around 300 precincts). The hope is that, once we
exclude places where voters are demonstrably acting strategically, these
assumptions are a reasonable approximation of reality.  (There are other things
we can do to probe these assumptions, but they take more time and computational
resources than I had available.)</p>
