    <h2>How the odds have changed</h2>
    <p>
    The model is continuously updated with new polling data and
    approval ratings. As new information comes in, the odds may shift
    towards one party or another. Additionally, as we get closer to the
    election, there is less uncertainty in the result, since there is
    less time for a large shift in public opinion. This also changes
    the odds over time.
    </p>
    <p>
    The chart below plots the changing  odds of each party winning
    control. The estimates are plotted on a log-odds scale, instead of a
    traditional probability scale ranging from 0 to 100%. This is to 
    better reflect changes in probability&mdash;a shift from a 90% to
    95% chance is much more consequential than a change from 50 to 55%.

    <h2>Distribution of outcomes</h2>
    <p>
    The model doesn't produce a single estimate of the number of seats
    each party will win. Rather, it estimates a probability for each
    possible arrangement of seats. The model's overall guess is the
    median of the distribution of seats&mdash;where it is just as likely
    that the Democrats will win more seats as fewer seats.
    </p>
    <p>
    The table below summarizes the relative chances of each possible
    distribution of seats. The current distribution and the median
    outcome are highlighted. 218 seats are needed to control the House.

    <h2>National Polling</h2>
    <p>
    The basis of the model is the generic congressional ballot, which 
    asks survey respondents which parties' candidate they plan on
    supporting in their local House race. The model estimates the true
    support for each party over time, and forecasts this estimate
    forwards to Election Day.  The chart below plots these estimates,
    along with an accompanying error bar indicating the uncertainty in
    the estimates. Notice how the uncertainty increases dramatically
    from today towards Election Day.

    <h2>Model</h2>
    <p>
    The model operates in two broad stages: first, it estimates
    national voter intent on a weekly basis and forecasts this estimate
    forwards to Election Day; second, it uses its voter intent estimate
    to predict the number of seats won by each party, using past
    elections as a guide. The models for each of these stages  are
    described in more detail below.
    </p>
    <p>
    Each model is fully Bayesian and is estimated using Hamiltonian
    Monte Carlo (through the statistical package STAN). Weakly
    informative priors are used on all parameters. The voter intent model
    is re-estimated with each new set of polling data. The final
    results model, in contrast, is fit once on past election data, and
    the posterior samples are used to provide predictions for the 2018
    elections.
    </p>

    <h3>Voter Intent Model</h3>
    <p>
    Voter intent is estimated from generic ballot polls conducted by 
    various polling firms. These ask survey respondents which parties'
    candidate they plan on supporting in their local House race. By
    aggregating poll results we can arrive at an estimate of national
    voter intent.
    </p>
    <p>
    Voter intent is estimated on a weekly basis, from the first week of
    polling through Election Day. It is measured on a log-odds scale
    and is denoted $\mu_t$, where $t$ is the week in question. Intent
    is assumed to evolve as an AR(1) process, or mean-reverting random
    walk: $$
        \mu_t \sim \mathrm{t}_{\nu}(\rho\cdot\mu_{t-1}, \sigma^2_w),
    $$
    where $\rho$ is a parameter representing the strength of the mean
    reversion (restricted to be between 0 and 1),  $\sigma^2_w$ is the
    variance of the random walk, and $\nu$ is the degrees of freedom of
    the <i>t</i>-distribution. The heavier tails of the
    <i>t</i>-distribution allow more extreme shifts in public opinion
    to occur, which may happen after a significant political
    development. While a more accurate generative model might be a 
    finite mixture model in which public opinion is static most of the
    time, but able to change dramatically after a major shock, the 
    added complexity of such a model would be unlikely to provide a
    commensurate increase in accuracy. The priors for the parameters
    are: 
    $$ \begin{align} 
        \mu_0 &\sim \mathrm{t}_{\nu}(0, 10^2) \\ 
        \nu &\sim \mathrm{Gamma}(2, 0.1) \\
        \sigma_w &\sim \mathrm{Cauchy}^+(0, 10) \\
        \rho &\sim \mathrm{Beta}(2, 1)
    \end{align}$$
    </p>
    <p>
    Polling results are derived from national voter intent. For each 
    poll $i$ we record the sample size, $n_i$, the week it was conducted,
    $t_i$, the polling firm which conducted it, $f_i$, the number of 
    respondents picking either major party (as opposed to 
    &ldquo;undecided&rdquo;), $n^s_i$, and the number picking the 
    Democratic party, $n^d_i$. Both $n^s_i$ and $n^d_i$ are drawn from
    a binomial distribution,
    $$ \begin{align} 
        n^s_i &\sim \mathrm{Binom}(n_i, \pi_u) \\
        n^d_i &\sim \mathrm{Binom}(n^s_i, \pi_i) 
    \end{align}$$
    where $\pi_u$ is the proportion of undecided voters nationally, and
    $\pi_i$ is the level of support for the Democrats in the given poll.
    This differs from $\mu$, since polling firms sample differently and
    have different methodologies. $\pi_i$ is modelled on a log-odds
    scale as a linear function of national voter intent, polling firm
    bias, and poll-specific (sampling) error:
    $$
        \mathrm{logit}(\pi_i) = \mu_{t_i} + \alpha_{f_i} + \epsilon_i,
    $$
    where $\alpha_{f_i}$ is the bias of the polling firm $f_i$ and 
    $\epsilon_i$ is the poll-specific error. Both $\alpha_{f_i}$ and 
    $\epsilon_i$ are assumed to be drawn from larger distributions of
    all possible firm and poll errors:
    $$ \begin{align} 
        \alpha \sim \mathrm{t}_2(\mu_f, \sigma^2_f) \\
        \epsilon \sim \mathrm{t}_2(0, \sigma^2_\epsilon)
    \end{align}$$
    The priors for the hyperparameters are
    $$ \begin{align} 
        \mu_f &\sim \mathcal{N}(0, 0.02) \\
        \sigma_f &\sim \mathrm{t}^+_4(0, 1) \\
        \sigma_\epsilon &\sim \mathrm{t}^+_4(0, 1) 
    \end{align}$$
    Polling firm errors are not fixed to have a mean of zero since in a
    given election year, there will be an aggregate polling error by
    all firms.  This is generally within two percentage points, thus the
    prior or $\mu_f$.
    </p>

    $$ \begin{align} 
    \end{align}$$

    <h3>Final Results Model</h3>
    <p>
    The final results model is essentially a linear model regressing
    the change in Democratic seats on national voter intent and several
    other structural and economic covariates. Importantly, measurement
    error in voter intent is explicitly modelled.
    </p>
    <p>
    The model is fit using data from the 1974, 1982, 1994, 1998, 2000,
    2002, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010, 2012, and 2014 House elections, which
    were all the years in which generic ballot polling data were
    available.
    </p>
    <p>
    The number of seats won by the Democratic party in election $j$ is
    denoted $s_j$. Voter intent at Election Day, measured on a log-odds
    scale, is denoted $\mu$, and all other covariates are included in a
    vector $X$. Then the model specification is
    $$
    s_j-s_{j-1} \sim \mathcal{N}(\beta_0 + \beta_1\mu + X\vec\beta, \sigma),
    $$
    where $\sigma$ is the error. However, we cannot observe $\mu$ 
    directly&mdash;we can only obtain an estimate of it, $\tilde\mu$, with
    some uncertainty $\sigma^2_\mu$ (both of which are taken from the
    posterior distribution of the voter intent model, which is very
    close to normal): 
    $$
        \tilde\mu \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2_\mu).
    $$
    The priors for the parameters are
    $$ \begin{align} 
        \mu &\sim \mathcal{N}(0, 1) \\
        \beta_0 &\sim \mathrm{t}_3(0, 10) \\
        \beta_1 &\sim \mathrm{t}_3(0, 10) \\
        \vec\beta &\sim \mathrm{t}_3(0, 10) \\
        \sigma &\sim \mathrm{Cauchy}^+(0, 20) 
    \end{align}$$
    </p>
    <p>
    The model forecasts the change in Democratic seats, which is highly
    dependent on whether or not there is a Democratic president. 
    Consequently, most of the terms in the model are interacted with an
    indicator representing the incumbent party in the White House (1 if 
    a Democrat, &ndash;1 if a Republican).
    The full set of additional model covariates is described in the
    following table:
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Term</th><th>Expected effect this election</th><th>Notes</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>$midterm$</td>
            <td>â€“7 seats</td>
            <td>The midterm indicator takes on a value of 1 in midterm
                elections and 0 otherwise. Regardless of the party in
                power, Democrats generally underperform in midterm
                elections due to low turnout.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>$pres$</td>

            <td>This is one of the most important terms in the model, 
                since it captures the tendency of midterm elections to

                president.</td>

                of the economy, which is important in judging the
