<p><span class="leadin">“Big Labor’s Big Shrink,”</span> gloated
the headline of a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/big-labors-big-shrink-11556580340"><em>Wall Street Journal</em>
editorial</a>
earlier this year, using Joe Biden’s presidential campaign kickoff at a
union hall as an opportunity to trot out its tried-and-true union-bashing
lines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Big Labor,&rdquo; the right's favorite moniker for America's unions, suggests a
force to be reckoned with, a monolithic entity&mdash;one with ambition, strategy,
and means. &ldquo;Big Labor&rdquo; and &ldquo;Big Government&rdquo; are supposed to go hand in hand. The
<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/AFL-CIO/@38.9010963,-77.0383432,17z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x89b7b7a3b596fd43:0xb9f2db5b9ddc26c1!8m2!3d38.9010963!4d-77.0361543">AFL-CIO
headquarters</a>,
after all, sits just across Lafayette Square from the White House.</p>
<p>But just as the forces of American capital are not controlled by the Chamber of
Commerce&mdash;which is also located across from the White House&mdash;labor's power
isn't managed out of D.C., doled out by union bosses as part of a Big Plan to
destroy productivity and end freedom as we know it. American labor is a
patchwork: a tangled web of national and local unions, federations, councils,
joint boards, and nonprofits.</p>
<p>That's not to say that labor's power isn't concentrated in certain regions,
sectors, or unions. But to ignore the diversity of labor's contituent parts
is to fail to grasp to complexity of the labor movement, and the challenges it
faces. Despite recent optimism and a wave of <a href="https://labornotes.org/blogs/2018/10/teacher-strike-wave-numbers">public sector
strikes</a>,
labor's power is still waning, <a href="https://jacobinmag.com/2019/06/private-sector-strike-wave-union-strategy">especially in the private
sector</a>.
And despite SEIU's aggressive aquisition strategy, and the mergers of several
national unions over the past few decades, unions in the United States remain
more fragmented than their peers abroad.  Understanding this fragmented
landscape is critical to building a grand strategy for American labor in this
centurty.</p>
<h1 id="what-does-big-mean-anyway">What does &ldquo;Big&rdquo; mean, anyway?</h1>
<section class="scroll-interactive" id="a1">
<p>In 2018, there were <strong>156 million people employed in the United States</strong>: 20
million in the public sector, and 136 million in the private sector. Of these,
just over 10 percent were union members&mdash;a total of <strong>14.7 million union
workers.</strong> These workers are split roughly evenly between the public and
private sectors, meaning that <strong>93.6 percent</strong> of private-sector workers are
not represented by a union.</p>
<p>The 7.6 million unionized private-sector workers are represented by <strong>15,047
different local unions</strong>&mdash;most affiliated with one of 132 &ldquo;international&rdquo;
unions, but many others belonging to independent or unafilliated unions.</p>
<p>Each circle below represents an international union, sized in proportion to
the union's overall membership (in all sectors). Unions in blue are <span
class="dark highlight" style="background: #5fb0e6">affiliated with the
AFL-CIO,</span> the umbrella organization for the labor movement. Unions in
green are <span class="dark highlight" style="background: #73bc5e">affiliated
with the Change to Win Federation</span> (CTW), which broke away from the
AFL-CIO in 2005. Unions in yellow are <span class="highlight"
style="background: #eebc3b">independent.</span> You can hover over each union
to learn more.</p>

<div class="text" id="a1s20">
<p>
    The <b>NEA</b> and the <b>AFT</b>, which both represent teachers,
    collectively represent over 4.5 million workers. Other large unions include
    <b>AFSCME</b>, which represents state and local government employees,
    <b>UFCW</b>, <b>SEIU</b>, and the <b>Teamsters (IBT)</b>, which each
    represent workers in a diverse array of industries.
</p>
<p>
    But even these large unions together represent only a minority of all 
    unionized workers. Millions more belong to industry-specific small
    international unions, like the 22,000-strong United Union of Roofers,
    Waterproofers and Allied Workers (<b>RWAW</b>).
</p>
</div>
<div class="text" id="a1s30">
    For comparison, here are the largest public and private employers in the
    U.S., sized by the number of their employees: <b>Walmart</b> (2.2 million)
     and the <b>Department of Defense</b> (3.2 million).
</div>
<div class="extra text" id="a1s40">
<p>
    The NEA may have the most members, but that doesn't necessarily translate
    to financial strength. When we size each union by its net assets, a
    different set of "big" unions emerges.
</p>
<p>
    The <b>UAW</b> is the wealthiest union, with <b>$1 billion</b> in net
    assets, mostly consisting of its large strike fund. Other wealthy unions,
    like the <b>USW</b>, <b>CJA</b>, and <b>IBEW</b>, consist mainly of workers
    in declining industries (like steel) or industries that have largely
    de-unionized (like construction).
</p>
</div>
<div class="text" id="a1s50">
<p>
    For comparison, here's <b>Berkshire Hathaway</b>, the U.S. corporation
    with the most equity: $348.7 billion.
</p>
<p>
    That's <b>over forty times</b> the net assets of all the international
    unions combined. In a single company.
