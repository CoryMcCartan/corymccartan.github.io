<p><span class="leadin">“Big Labor’s Big Shrink,”</span> gloated
the headline of a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/big-labors-big-shrink-11556580340"><em>Wall Street Journal</em>
editorial</a>
earlier this year, using Joe Biden’s presidential campaign kickoff at a
union hall as an opportunity to trot out its tried-and-true union-bashing
lines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Big Labor&rdquo; suggests a force to be reckoned with, a monolithic entity&mdash;one
with ambition, strategy, and means. &ldquo;Big Labor&rdquo; and &ldquo;Big Government&rdquo; are
supposed to go hand in hand. The <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/AFL-CIO/@38.9010963,-77.0383432,17z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x89b7b7a3b596fd43:0xb9f2db5b9ddc26c1!8m2!3d38.9010963!4d-77.0361543">AFL-CIO
headquarters</a>,
after all, sits just across Lafayette Square from the White House.</p>
<p>But just as the forces of American capital are not controlled by the Chamber of
Commerce&mdash;which is also located across from the White House&mdash;labor's power
isn't managed out of D.C., doled out by union bosses as part of a Big Plan to
destroy productivity and end freedom as we know it. American labor is a
patchwork: a tangled web of national and local unions, federations, councils,
joint boards, and nonprofits.</p>
<p>That's not to say that labor's power isn't concentrated in certain regions,
sectors, or unions. But to ignore the diversity of labor's contituent parts
is to fail to grasp to complexity of the labor movement, and the challenges it
faces. Despite recent optimism and a wave of <a href="https://labornotes.org/blogs/2018/10/teacher-strike-wave-numbers">public sector
strikes</a>,
labor's power is still waning, <a href="https://jacobinmag.com/2019/06/private-sector-strike-wave-union-strategy">especially in the private
sector</a>.
And despite SEIU's aggressive aquisition strategy, and the mergers of several
national unions over the past few decades, unions in the United States remain
more fragmented than their peers abroad.  Understanding this fragmented
landscape is critical to building a grand strategy for American labor in this
centurty.</p>
<h1 id="what-does-big-mean-anyway">What does &ldquo;Big&rdquo; mean, anyway?</h1>
<section class="scroll-interactive" id="a1">
<p>In 2018, there were <strong>156 million people employed in the United States</strong>: 20
million in the public sector, and 136 million in the private sector. Of these,
just over 10 percent were union members&mdash;a total of <strong>14.7 million union
workers.</strong> These workers are split roughly evenly between the public and
private sectors, meaning that <strong>93.6 percent</strong> of private-sector workers are
not represented by a union.</p>
<p>The 7.6 million unionized private-sector workers are represented by <strong>15,047
different local unions</strong>&mdash;most affiliated with one of 132 &ldquo;international&rdquo;
unions, but many others belonging to independent or unafilliated unions.</p>
<p>Each circle below represents an international union, sized in proportion to
the union's overall membership (in all sectors). Unions in blue are <span
class="dark highlight" style="background: #5fb0e6">affiliated with the
AFL-CIO,</span> the umbrella organization for the labor movement. Unions in
green are <span class="dark highlight" style="background: #73bc5e">affiliated
with the Change to Win Federation</span> (CTW), which broke away from the
AFL-CIO in 2005. Unions in yellow are <span class="highlight"
style="background: #eebc3b">independent.</span> You can hover over each union
to learn more, and click to highlight one.</p>
<div class="chart" id="intl-chart-a1"></div>
<div class="text" id="a1s20">
<p>
    The <b>NEA</b> and the <b>AFT</b>, both teachers' unions, collectively
    represent over 4.5 million workers. Other large unions include
    <b>AFSCME</b>, which represents state and local government employees,
    <b>UFCW</b>, <b>SEIU</b>, and the <b>Teamsters (IBT)</b>, which each
    represent workers in a diverse array of industries.
</p>
<p>
    But even these large unions together represent only a minority of all 
    unionized workers. Millions more belong to industry-specific small
    international unions, like the 22,000-strong United Union of Roofers,
    Waterproofers and Allied Workers (<b>RWAW</b>).
</p>
</div>
<div class="text" id="a1s25">
    And another <b>760,681</b> belong to independent, unaffiliated local unions.
</div>
<div class="text" id="a1s30">
    For comparison, here are the largest public and private employers in the
    U.S., sized by the number of their employees: <b>Walmart</b> (2.2 million)
     and the <b>Department of Defense</b> (3.2 million).
</div>
<div class="extra text" id="a1s40">
<p>
    So in one sense, unions are &ldquo;big&rdquo; enough to go up against the
    largest employers in the country. But while a union like the NEA may have
    the most members, that doesn't necessarily translate to financial resources,
    which are often a more important factor. When we size each union by its net
    assets, a different set of "big" unions emerges.
</p>
<p>
    The <b>UAW</b> is the wealthiest international union, with <b>$1
    billion</b> in net assets, mostly consisting of its large strike fund.
    Other wealthy unions, like the <b>USW</b>, <b>CJA</b>, and <b>IBEW</b>,
    consist mainly of workers in declining industries (like steel) or
    industries that have significantly de-unionized (like construction).
</p>
</div>
<div class="text" id="a1s50">
<p>
    For comparison, here's <b>Berkshire Hathaway</b>, the U.S. corporation
    with the most net assets: $348.7 billion.
</p>
<p>
    That's <b>over forty times</b> the net assets of all the international
    unions combined. In a single company.
</p>
<p>
    With corporations operating on this kind of scale, it's no surprise that
    the UFCW (net assets of $336 million) has struggled to unionize Walmart
    (net assets of $80 <i>billion</i>). 
</p>
</div>
<div class="center text">
    So is &ldquo;Big Labor&rdquo; really all that big?

<h1 id="savers-and-spenders">Savers and Spenders</h1>
<section class="scroll-interactive" id="a2">
<p>Beyond the size of their membership, another important way that unions differ
is in the scale of their financial resources relative to their membership,
and how they choose to spend these resources.</p>
<p>Below, unions are arranged from left to right in order of their per-member
net assets. This is a good measure of unions&rsquo; wealth, as it accounts for
the size of the membership&mdash;we would expect larger unions to be able
to collect more dues, and therefore to have more net assets.</p>
<p><span id="a2s20"></span>
The wealthiest union on a per-member basis is the <b>American Train Dispatchers
Association</b>, a small craft union. The <b>UAW</b>, the union with the most
total net assets, still is near the top on a per-member basis.  The largest
unions, like the <b>NEA</b>, generally have fewer net assets per member due to
their extremely large size.</p>
<div class="chart" id="intl-chart-a2"></div>
<div class="text" id="a2s30">
    The picture changes slightly when we sort unions by their spending per
    member. For example,  both the <b>IBEW</b> and the <b>UAW</b> are in the
    upper half of unions by wealth. But while the UAW has around quadruple the
    net assets per member of the IBEW, the IBEW spends almost triple what the
    UAW does per member.
</div>
<div class="text" id="a2s40">
<p>
    This split becomes even clearer when unions are ranked by how much they
    spend, relative to how much they're worth. 
</p>
<p>
    Unions like the <b>AFT</b> or the <b>AFGE</b> spent around three times their
    total assets in 2018, while the <b>UAW</b> and the <b>CJA</b> spent less
    than a quarter of their total assets.
</p>
</div>
<div class="center text">
    But <i>how much</i> unions spend may not matter as much as <i>where</i>
    they spend it.
</div>
<div class="text" id="a2s45">
<p>
    Most union spending, after taxes and AFL-CIO dues, can be roughly broken up
    into four categories:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Representational</b>: contract negotiations, grievance handling,
        corporate research, litigation, and <i>new worker organizing</i>.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Political</b>: spending on political candidates (including through
        PACs) and lobbying.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Benefit & grant</b>: pensions, health and life insurance,
        charitable contributions, scholarship funds, and more.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Overhead</b>: membership meeting, conferences, supplies, rent,
        support staff, member education programs, and more.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Several important unions which prioritize these categories differently are
    highlighted below.
</p>
<p>
    It's important to note that local unions also spend in these categories,
    and are not included in the figures below.
</p>
</div>
<div class="text" id="a2s50">
    Of the very large unions, the <b>SEIU</b> spends the largest portion of its
    budget on representation and organizing.  The <b>IUJAT</b>, the oldest
    union in continuous existence in the U.S., and the <b>AFA</b>, which has
    been organizing agressively in major airlines, also top the chart for
    representational spending.
</div>
<div class="text" id="a2s70">
<p>
    Unsurprisingly, the <b>NEA</b>, <b>AFT</b> and other largely public-sector
    unions like <b>AFSCME</b> and the <b>IAFF</b>, are heavily involved in
    lobbying. The <b>SEIU</b> is also known for its political spending, like the
    $28 million it spent on Barack Obama's campaign in 2008. 
</p>
<p>
    Notably, the much smaller <b>IUJAT</b> and <b>AFA</b>, which both spend
    heavily on representation and organizing, each spend less than 2% of their
    budgets on lobbying and politics. 
</p>
</div>
<div class="text" id="a2s75">
    The <b>NEA</b> stands out for spending nearly half its budget on benefits,
    grants, and contributions.  It donates heavily to nonprofit organizations
    across the country. The <b>SEIU</b>, in contrast, spends around 7% of its
    budget on benefits and grants.
</div>
<div class="text" id="a2s80">
    There are few clear patterns in how much unions spend on administration and
    overhead. Some, like the <b>IAFF</b>, spend nearly 60%; others, like the
    <b>IUJAT</b>, spend 5%.
</div>
<div style="height: 80vh"></div>
<div class="text">
<p>
    We can actually visualize all of this together, mapping unions onto a 
    triangle, below, based on their spending priorities. A union which spends
    100% of its budget on representation and organizing would be located at
    the top of the triangle, while a union that spent a third of its budget on
    representation, a third on grants, and a third on lobbying and overhead would
    be located in the middle.
</p>
<p>
    While there are unions spread all over the chart, the striking pattern is 
    just how many unions are clustered in the bottom right.  Nearly all
    international unions spend a majority of their budgets on administration,
    overhead, and lobbying.  There are good reasons for this, in many cases.
</p>
<p>
    But some of the unions which have grown most aggressively&mdash;like the
    SEIU&mdash; or which are widely recognized as democratic and
    innovative&mdash;like UNITE HERE, the AFA, or UE&mdash;are closer to the
    middle. And many shrinking unions&mdash;like IBEW, CJA, or IUOE&mdash;are
    stuck in the bottom-right corner.

<section class="scroll-interactive" id="a4">
<p>Money to organize and represent workers means little without the people who
make unions work: officers, organizers and staff.</p>
<p>Unions employ vastly different numbers of staff relative to their size.
Unsurprisingly, very large unions like the <b>NEA</b> have high member-to-staff
ratios (4,164 workers per staff member), while small unions like the
Inlandboatmen's Union (<b>IBU</b>) have very low ratios (25 workers per staff
member). But even some large unions like the <b>USW</b> and <b>UAW</b> manage
to keep low member-to-staff ratios, while some small unions like the Marine
Engineers (<b>MEBA</b>) and <b>IUJAT</b> have ratios exceeding 3,000-to-1.</p>
<div class="chart" id="intl-chart-a4"></div>
<div class="text" id="a4s20">
While there is large variation in how many staff unions hire, there is slightly
less variation in what these staff are paid.  Most major unions pay their staff
a median salary between $70,000 and $130,000 a year, though some, like the 
<b>IUEC</b>, pay as much as $212,000 a year.  Of the unions with at least a
million members, the <b>IBT</b> pays its staff the least: just over $80,000
a year.
</div>
<div class="text" id="a4s30">
For comparison, the dashed line shows the median wage for union workers,
before benefits.
</div>
<div class="text">
    Finally, international unions are just the tip of the iceberg. The majority
    of representational and organizing work happens at the local level.  And
    while unfortunately there doesn't exist readily accessible complete data on
    all local unions in the country, across all sectors, we can look at one
    important aspect of local unions: their size.
</div>
<div class="text" id="a4s40">
<p>
    Below, unions are arranged by the average size of their locals. Unions must
    strike a balance between the added efficiency of pooling resources across
    many workers and workplaces, and the challenges in representing large
    numbers of workers at once.
</p>
<p>
    The <b>SEIU</b> is by far the most centralized union, with more than 18,000
    members in its average local. On the other end of the spectrum, craft
    unions like the Insulators (<b>HFIA</b>) or city-based unions like the East
    coast Longshormen (<b>ILA</b>) have smaller locals.
</p>
</div>
</section>
<div style="height: calc(15vh + 35vw)"></div>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>American unions are as varied as the workers and professions they represent.
They differ in their membership, their financial resources, their local union
structure, their spending priorities, and their staffing levels.  Uniting them,
however, is their shared mission to improve the lot of the average worker, and
to give working people everywhere more of a say in how our society is run.</p>
<p>And now labor has an opportunity. Half of nonunion workers&mdash;<b>67 million
people</b>&mdash;<a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/a-growing-number-of-americans-want-to-join-a-union">say they would join a union if they
could</a>,
a massive increase over previous years, and public support for unions is higher
than it has been in decades.  To make the most of this opportunity, unions will
have to organize aggressively, democratize, and learn from one another.</p>
<p>Some of the differences between unions are justified. Others are accidents of
history.  But unions can set budgets and priorities, and can partner and merge.
Making these decisions strategically, and with an eye to what has worked for
other unions, will be necessary to ensuring that unions and workers can win in
the decades ahead.</p>
