explains the motivation, and provides a less-detailed overview of the
methodology than that provided below.</p>

<h2 id="why-does-this-approach-work">Why does this approach work?</h2>
<p>While head-to-head polls are generally not very predictive, the demographic
patterns they reveal turn out to be much more durable, as the figure below
illustrates. Polled demographic patterns (a candidate&rsquo;s support in a demographic
group, minus their overall support), on the horizontal axis, are compared to
actual election reults on the vertical. Polls are shown for presidential
elections since 2002, using available Quinnipiac demographic cross tabs, and
exit poll results.</p>

<h2 id="methodology-summary">Methodology summary</h2>
<p>I did some matrix algebra to basically estimate the (linear model) coefficients
on each demographic category (white, college-educated, gender, etc.) and their
interactions from the poll crosstabs.  Ideally these would have been estimated
using stratification from a multilevel Bayesian model.  Either way, the
predictions from this model were used as starting points in the next step.</p>
<p>I used exit poll and CPS microdata to build a synthetic electorate, with vote
preferences by each cell (state×demographic) fit using iterative
proportional fitting (and initialized to the model predictions above) so that
the marginal totals matched state returns and national demographic crosstabs.
Then I reweighted to account for 4 years of demographic change, to create a
synthetic 2020 electorate.</p>
<p>Then, for each candidate, I computed the difference between the candidate&rsquo;s
support in each demographic group (on the logit scale) and the candidate&rsquo;s
overall support (also on the logit scale).  These differences were then
differenced again with the Clinton numbers from 2016.  Basically we get a
number saying how much to shift each demographic group on the logit scale.
These shifts are applied again through the iterative proportional fitting
algorithm.  The national shift is applied in the same way.</p>
<p>To account for error in the polls, I took the within-poll and across-poll error
and simulated varying polling numbers by candidate, and then reran the
analysis.</p>
