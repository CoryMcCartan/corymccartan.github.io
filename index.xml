      <description>Suppose—hypothetically—that you find yourself one evening, early in the  second summer of our pandemic, reading your email, when you open up an advertisement for discounted train tickets.</description>

      <description>Some unions have relatively even local memberships, others have huge  disparities in size between their largest and smallest locals.  Why? And can we measure it?</description>

      <description>In a place where religious polarization is stronger than political  polarization (though they are intertwined), how does the redistricting  process look? Are the boundaries fair? Random simulations can provide an answer.</description>

      <description>Last week, Biden outspent Trump on Facebook by more than a 2-to-1 margin. But per-state spending has little to do with how competitive each state is, and everything to do with how many supportive voters live there.</description>

      <description>2020 FORECASTS  President Senate House      NOTE  This model relies on second-quarter GDP growth to build a prior estimate of the election day vote share. On Thursday, July 30, advance Q2 GDP estimates were released which were substantially below Federal Reserve forecasts, and much worse than any GDP data since records have been kept. Directly inputting this GDP estimate into the model here would not provide an accurate picture of the economic and political uncertainty resulting from the coronavirus pandemic.</description>

      <description>All of the numbers floating around about the coronavirus can obscure the one  simple fact that we must all remember if we are to be disciplined enough in our social distancing: this pandemic is deadly serious, and if we don’t continue to take drastic action, at an individual and societal level, then someone you know will probably die.</description>

      <description>2020 FORECASTS  President Senate House       What does a  chance feel like? Click the button below to randomly simulate a hypothetical election. While the Democrats may be favored to win, there&#39;s a lot of variation in how many seats they may gain or lose. Simulate an election  
How the odds have changed The model works by using economic indicators, structural factors (like whether it is a midterm year, or the party that controls the White House), and national polling data to estimate what the nationwide popular vote (adding up all the votes for each party in all 435 districts) and the seat breakdown will be.</description>

      <description>Caucuses have a distinct advantage over primaries, which are conducted by ballot: after an initial tally of candidates’ support, voters can realign themselves into new groups before the final count. This realignment process can provide valuable insight into the preferences of voters, and help us understand how the race might change if more candidates start to drop out.</description>

      <title>On a Streak?</title>

      <description>Streaks are an important part of how we experience a place&amp;rsquo;s weather: it matters not just how hot it gets, or how much it rains, but also how long these kinds of weather stick around. Mathematically, one way to understand these patterns is through Markov chains. Thinking of weather in this way can reveal some interesting patterns, and confirm some stereotypes.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s hard to watch the steadiness of Donald Trump&amp;rsquo;s job approval numbers&amp;mdash;43% of voters approving and 52% disapproving, for most of the last year&amp;mdash;and not be convinced that Americans are deeply polarized: one half watches Fox news, the other half watches MSNBC; one half hates immigrants, the other embraces them; one half thinks climate change is a hoax, the other wants to pass the Green New Deal. Neither half wants their children to marry a member of the other half.</description>

      <description>AFL-CIO headquarters, Washington, D.C.
  There is power there is power in a band of workingmen,
When they stand hand in hand,
That&amp;rsquo;s a power, that&amp;rsquo;s a power
That must rule in every land—
One Industrial Union Grand.
 &amp;mdash; &amp;ldquo;There is Power in a Union,&amp;rdquo; Joe Hill   “Big Labor’s Big Shrink,” gloated the headline of a Wall Street Journal editorial last year, using Joe Biden’s presidential campaign kickoff at a union hall as an opportunity to trot out its tried-and-true union-bashing lines.</description>

      <description>The interactive below accompanies this article I wrote for the Washington Post. The article has some other figures, explains the motivation, and provides a less-detailed overview of the methodology than that provided below.
If the national popular vote were  50.0% Democratic and 50.0% Republican, we&#39;d expect the candidates to win these states:  (Drag the vertical line)
    Why does this approach work? While head-to-head polls are generally not very predictive, the demographic patterns they reveal turn out to be much more durable, as the figure below illustrates.</description>

As new information comes in, the odds may shift towards one party or another. Additionally, as we get closer to the election, there is less uncertainty in the result, since there is less time for a large shift in public opinion.</description>

      <title>37 Supreme Court Justices on a Plane</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The most common measure of Supreme Court justice ideology are the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://mqscores.lsa.umich.edu/&#34;&gt;Martin&amp;ndash;Quinn scores&lt;/a&gt;, developed by the
eponymous political scientists.  Since their &lt;a href=&#34;https://mqscores.lsa.umich.edu/media/pa02.pdf&#34;&gt;original publication in
2002&lt;/a&gt;, the scores have been
widely used, in political science and in the media, to place justices on
a left&amp;ndash;right political spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Corresponding to each point in and around the Mandelbrot set is a Julia set. If we start with a point near the origin, and move it in a circle around the main bulb of the Mandelbrot set, the series of corresponding Julia sets morph beautifully into one another.</description>
